# Mario Plays With Fire

https://youtu.be/kQc08akF-6Q

In this game, fire works like lighting. Inspired by the Lightning Redirection mechanic of Sekiro Shadows Die Twice, Mario will jump to catch fireballs that would otherwise hurt him while he is on the ground. He must then release the fireball before he touches the ground again or he will be damaged. Please note that he will take damage from fireballs in the air even after he has caught a fireball.

- Press spacebar to jump and catch a fireball.
  - Press spacebar while in the air after catching a fireball to shoot the fireball back.
- WASD for movement.
- If Mario happens to lose balance and falls over, just press spacebar to make him get back up.
